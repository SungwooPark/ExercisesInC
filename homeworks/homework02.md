### Think OS Chapter 2 reading questions

For each of the reading questions below, write answers in the form of
a clear, concise, complete sentence or two.

1. Give a real-world example of virtualization (ideally not one of 
the ones in the book).  What is abstractly true about the system that
is not literally true about the implementation?
- When you input a time in a microwave, you get a food microwaved for that amount of time. That is an abstraction becuase in terms of implementation, what is really happening is that the electrical signal from buttons are translated into inner mechanisms that operate the microwave for that amount of time.

2. What is the difference between a program and a process?
- A process is a single instance of a running program that is isolated from other parts of an operating system. Program is like a class in an objected-oriented programming paradigm, while a process is like an instance.

3. What is the primary purpose of the process abstraction? 
- The primiary purpose of the process abrstraction is to allow people to use complicated systems or process without having to fully understand how underlying details work.

4. What illusion does the process abstraction create?
- The process abstraction creates an illusion that your simple action directly translates into an expected result without any underlying processes that actually enable that interaction.

5. What is the kernel?
- The kernel is a part of an operating system responsible for core capabilities of an operating system.

6. What is a daemon?
- A daemon is a process running on the background that provide an operating system useful services.
